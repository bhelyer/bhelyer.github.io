	<a href="snake/snake.html"><h4>Snake</h4></a>
	
	<p>A clone of the classic game Snake written in JavaScript, using text.
	   Keyboard controls only. Looking back on this, my favourite feature is being
	   able to perform a 180 degree turn while moving entirely in a straight line,
	   leading to an instant game over.</p>
	   
	<a href="jsrogue/jsrogue.html"><h4>JSRogue</h4></a>
	
	<p>Continuing the theme of moving an @ about in a monospaced font, JSRogue is an
	   uncompleted roguelike written in JavaScript, using text. However, this time a
	   little bit of HTML and CSS has been used.</p>
	<p>This was sitting on the previous iteration of my website for years with the
	   Japanese language toggle broken. Apparently a call to redraw the screen went
	   missing. I've fixed that.
	<p>(As a note, the translations were all, as far as I can recall, written
	   by me and not Google translate. I'm sure they're all stilted, awful, and generally
	   wrong. ごめんなさい！)</p>
	<p>I don't hate the presentation of this one. JavaScript isn't a language I really
	   enjoy writing code in, so I'm not sure I'd revisit it. That being said, I <em>could</em>
	   use it as an excuse to play around with TypeScript...</p>
